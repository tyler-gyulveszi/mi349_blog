    <p>HEY! How's it going, my names Tyler Gyulveszi, thanks for visiting my about page! I am a computer science student at Michigan
    State University. I love working on my own or collaborating with others to work on personal projects. I have played soccer since I 
    was around 7 or 8 years old, and still have a great deal of passion for the game. I spend as much time as I can outside going for walks, 
    hikes, fishing, or just having lunch outside. 
    </p>
